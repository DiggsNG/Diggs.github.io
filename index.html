He was originally born in a small town in Alabama and migrated to California as a child with his mother and younger brother. As a southern child in a new environment, he found life in grade school to be quit challenging. The fact that he had a southern drawl and his mother dressed him and his brother in very fancy clothes did not help. 
            It was during those early years that he developed a love for sport and technology. High school proved to be a very exciting time for young Nolen. He played football, ran track, and took electronic classes. His goals, during this period, were to have fun, win football games, do well in school, and win track meets. Also, he had the opportunity/pleasure to escort the home coming queen.  
            Upon graduating from high. he then enrolled in collage and determined that his true direction was in computer information systems. He found college life challenging and rewarding. He joined business groups and participated in many events. It was during his participation in one of those groups that he met and IBM recruiter. After this meeting, the recruiter asked him to call a manager in the Los Angeles downtown office. His career with IBM proved to be very rewarding and memorable.
